A safer way to process names
Every user input is an attack surface and traditionally names have been part of the "user record".
Instead of accepting user names as part of an account would it be more secure to store all "names" in a name database and only retrieve those when they need to be displayed.  Until then user names can be represented by thier inverted frequency count in the sample therby minimizing the storage requirements and security exposure.
